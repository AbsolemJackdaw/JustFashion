### Creating a Fashion Pack

__Step 1__ : Create a texture.

Pants Sample : ![](http://i.imgur.com/a1wjSUe.png)  
Boots Sample : ![](http://i.imgur.com/zorbCNq.png)  

__Step 2__ : Put them in the correct location  
assets/fashion/textures/fashionpack/  "FashionPackName"  /  (hats/body/pants/boots)  /  "myTexture.png"

__Step 3__ : Make an pack.mcmeta  
put it in next to the assets folder.  
your pack.mcmeta will look something like this.

__Step 4__ : Make a fashionpack.json
put it next to the textures folder

in the json file, 
* you'll give the pack a unique name.
* you'll need to give every texture name per category
    * (if you don't make textures for a certain category, you can leave it out)  
    
  
Your fashionpack.json might look something like this :

### Make sure to put all of this in a zip file !
